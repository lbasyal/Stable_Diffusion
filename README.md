# Stable_Diffusion

This repository explores stable diffusion for generating images. It contains two Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Base Model Notebook**: Demonstrates the base model for stable diffusion.
2. **Base + Refiner Notebook**: Presents the combined model with a refiner.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and the code to learn more about stable diffusion and image generation.
